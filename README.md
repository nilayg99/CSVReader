This code is written in Python and it is designed to read a CSV file and perform certain operations on it.

First, it checks whether the file path provided by the user is a CSV file or not. If it's a CSV file, it proceeds to check whether the file is empty or not. If the file is not empty, it reads the CSV file using the pandas library and displays the first 5 rows of the CSV file.

Then, it prompts the user to enter a list of columns they want to select from the CSV file. Once the user has entered the column names, the program selects the specified columns from the CSV file and displays the selected columns.

If the selected columns contain more than 1 KB of data, it prints a message saying that the file is too big.

If the original file path is not found, it prompts the user to enter a new file path and performs the same operations on the new file.
